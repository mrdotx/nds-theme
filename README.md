# notice

I do not support video game piracy in any form. Video game piracy leads to **stupid, short, ad-filled** games.

Buy games and use flashcards to play homebrew or copies you made yourself from your own games.

# hint

If you want to create your own graphics for the wood firmware, open your designed graphic in GIMP and export it to a 16 Bit Windows-Bitmap with:

*File -> Export As... -> Windows-Bitmap -> RGB format: 16 Bit (X1 R5 G5 B5)*

This leads to far better quality then the 16 bit conversions of the various skin editors.
